## HPC - A collection of projects done with numerical and parallel programming

Methods of parallelism included shared memory via openmp and pthreads, as well as distributed memory such as MPI

Each Sub directory is an assignment completed in the parallel programming class at Chico State

The Directory labeled "Project" is my Final Project, involving the speedup of counting prime numbers in a bounds using MPI.
